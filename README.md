# Lingo Archipelago Client
[Archipelago](https://archipelago.gg/) is an open-source project that supports randomizing a number of different games and combining them into one cooperative experience. Items from each game are hidden in other games. For more information about Archipelago, you can look at their website.

This is a project that modifies the game [Lingo](https://lingothegame.com/) so that it can be played as part of an Archipelago multiworld game.
